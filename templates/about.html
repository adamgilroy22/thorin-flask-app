        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
                youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
                participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
                the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
                found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
                in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also
                nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
                feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin
                Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing
                a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the
                Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company,
                as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and
                later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the
                company of Thorin.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>
                Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
                and younger brother of Óin. In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the
                last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution
                was, being 16 years old. In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to
                him and an unknown wife. In March of TA 2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard
                Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When
                Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also said that Hobbits "would never
                dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".

            <h3>Balin</h3>
            <p>
                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger
                brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely
                Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the
                Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA
                2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely
                Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
                younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
                accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin. Later in TA
                2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered
                Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845,
                Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a
                black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to
                inform him the news.

            <h3>Ori</h3>
            <p>
                Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori
                became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other
                Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the
                other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived. Ori was one of
                the several Dwarves that accompanied Balin to Moria in TA 2989 to begin a colony there. Though it saw
                initial success, the colony was destroyed in TA 2994 when the Balrog ( Durin's Bane) and Orcs began to
                press back from the initial fight. After Balin died, Ori and others lived just long enough to bury him
                properly in a stone tomb before dying themselves in the last stand in the Chamber of Mazarbul. Ori
                recalls his last moments in The Book of Mazarbul which Gandalf reads from when the Fellowship of the
                Ring passes by Balin's Tomb some twenty-four years later. His body is left clutching the scarred,
                bloodied, and shredded book; a warrior-scribe to the last breath.

            <h3>Dori</h3>
            <p>
                Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and
                Ori. In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling
                with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain. It fell to Dori to carry Bilbo Baggins in
                the tunnels of the Misty Mountains during the escape from the Goblins, but Dori dropped Bilbo, and the
                other Dwarves and Gandalf blamed him for "losing their burglar." Later, during their escape from the
                Wargs and Orcs, Dori helped Bilbo climb a tree to get away from the wargs. Bilbo shortly thereafter
                saved Dori by grabbing his legs as they were rescued by the Great Eagles and taken to their eyrie from
                the Misty Mountains. When Gandalf tells their tale to the skin-changer Beorn and brings forward the
                company, Dori came first, along with Thorin.

                Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with
                them. Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived
                in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers. In TA 2941, Nori, along with
                Dori and Ori, became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in
                search of Smaug's treasure in the Lonely Mountain. After their experience in Goblin-town when the
                company was pursued by Wargs and Orcs and forced to climb up into some trees, Nori was the first realize
                that Bilbo had been left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Dori who rescued Bilbo.

                Durin. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He
                and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced
                to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a
                new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

                dragon Smaug. Following the dragon's demise, Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five

                Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of
                Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown,
                though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of
                the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli
                was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the
                quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the
                loss of Thráin II.

                Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before
                the Music of the Ainur, and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä. In
                his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with
                light and fire, much like Varda, yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and
                patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them
                fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of
                Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him
